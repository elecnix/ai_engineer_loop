Implement a distributed rate limiter in Python that can be used across multiple servers to control API request rates.

Your solution should include:
- Support for multiple rate limit algorithms (Token Bucket, Leaky Bucket, etc.)
- Distributed synchronization across multiple instances
- Configurable rate limits per user/client/IP
- High performance with minimal lock contention
- Handling of clock drift and network partitions

Include tests that verify:
- Basic rate limiting functionality
- Distributed synchronization across instances
- Burst handling capabilities
- Dynamic rate limit updates

Implement from scratch without using existing rate limiting libraries.
