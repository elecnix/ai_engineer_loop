Create a Python function called 'fibonacci' that calculates the nth Fibonacci number.
The function should use memoization to optimize performance for large values of n.
Include comprehensive tests that verify the function works correctly for various inputs,
including edge cases like n=0 and n=1.
The tests should also verify that the function raises appropriate exceptions for invalid inputs,
such as negative numbers or non-integer values.
